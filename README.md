## Getting Started

```
git clone https://github.com/k4u5h4L/QuikCook.git && cd QuikCook/
```

- Check if flutter is woring fine by running:

```
flutter doctor -v
```

- Install dependencies (optional):

```
flutter pub get
```

- Run it on an emulator or physical device with:

```
flutter run
```

- To build a production release (mostly an APK, as ios is not properly configured), run:

```
flutter build apk
```

You can then find the apk at `build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-release.apk`.
